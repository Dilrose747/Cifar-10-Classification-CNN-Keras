# Cifar-10-Classification-CNN-Kera
Simple CNNs written in Keras to classify Cifar 10 image dataset.

This repository contains a shallow and little deeper CNN for classifying the Cifar-10 dataset.

The code has been taken from this amazing [blog](http://machinelearningmastery.com/object-recognition-convolutional-neural-networks-keras-deep-learning-library/).

Running the simpler network ```python Cifar10-Simple-CNN-Classifier.py``` gives an accuracy of 70.12%. 

While running the deeper network ```python Cifar10-Deeper-CNN-Classifier.py``` gives an accuracy of 78.31%.
